The first two columns of the data should be used as targets, and the remaining columns as features. Implement a common function for training and evaluation that takes the model, data, and experiment parameters as input. Train each experiment using this common function and evaluate them on the training data. Print the evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2) and display the training loss curves for all experiments in one place. Experiment 1 should use an MLP with 3 hidden layers (64, 32, 16). Experiments 2 and 4 should use an MLP with 2 hidden layers (64, 32). Experiment 3 should use an MLP with 3 hidden layers (128, 64, 32). Experiment 4 should explore different batch sizes. Ensure all code uses PyTorch."

Generally, a more complex model (more layers or neurons) might achieve lower training loss but could potentially overfit if not regularized.\n",
        "*   **Effect of Batch Size (Experiment 4):** Comparing the results within Experiment 4, you can see how different batch sizes affect the training convergence (from the loss curves) and the final performance on testing and live data. Smaller batch sizes often introduce more noise but can sometimes lead to better generalization, while larger batch sizes provide smoother convergence but might get stuck in local minima. The optimal batch size can be data and model dependent.\n",
